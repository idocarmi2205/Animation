We created a snake game, and tried to fully realize the game's potential, despite not being able to correctly complete the skinning algorithm.
Instead we focused our resources on making the best playable game that we could, including a high score and level openning system.
We ran into difficulties with the cubemap for a long time, because we didn't know how to work with shaders, and making the camera change to
the head of the snake was also not easy. We also invested a lot of time in the menu in order to make the game look and feel as good as possible.
